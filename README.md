# Note It README

A simple extension to save code snippets for later reference.

## Features

The extension allows you to select a snippet of code and add a comment to it which would be saved to new file.
This allows the user to refer the file to check the code snippet instead of searching the entire project directory

## Why this extension?

Usually new coders follow coding tutorials and comment out specific code snippets so that they can use it in some other projects. While commenting might be helpful, it is not efficient to search the entire project directory for specific functions.
Instead if the important code snippets are all in one file along with the description it would be much easier to refer back.

## Known Issues

The code selection is currently being shown as undefined.
The file is overwritten every time instead of appending.

## Features that can be added

Use a markdown file instead of text file for better readability.
Added links on top of the file to directly access particular code snippet.
Improve code formatting.

## Release Notes

1.0.0 Initial release.

## Enjoy!
